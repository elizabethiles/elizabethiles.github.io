# About

I am a research fellow at the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in the University of Sydney.
I am a native speaker of English but also have a relatively high Japanese language proficiency.

# Astronomy Research

I like to reseach barred-spiral galaxies and the stars in them.

You can find out about my publications [here](./reference-list.html)!

# Outreach

I also do outreach. I think it is important to inspire young people of all genders and socio-economic background to study science if it interests them!

# Science Education & Pedagogy

I am interested in understanding the way people 'learn' to *do science*. I don't believe this is an innate skill and, therefore, must be able to be developed. 
How can we (as scientists) facilitate others to develop these skills?
