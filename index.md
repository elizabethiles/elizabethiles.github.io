## About

I am a Research Associate in Galactic Archaeology at the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in the University of Sydney. I am also a Visiting Fellow at the University of New South Wales. 

I am a native speaker of English but I am also conversationally fluent in Japanese - I did my PhD (published in English) at the Univeristy of Hokkaido in Sapporo, Japan.

## Astronomy Research

I like to research barred-spiral galaxies and the stars in them. I personally develop N-body numerical simulations of (resolved) galaxies to study stellar populations and kinematics.

| IsoB is barred-spiral galaxy formed in isolation, while similar structure in TideB has been triggerd |
|  by interaction with a dwarf galaxy-like companion. |

I am also a member of <a href="https://astro3d.org.au">ASTRO3D</a>, the <a href="https://www.galah-survey.org">GALAH</a> and <a href="https://geckos-survey.org">GECKOS</a> survey collaboration teams.  

You can find out about my publications [here](./reference-list.html).

## Outreach

I am regularly invloved in science outreach activities, such as public talks, telescope tours and school visits. I think it is important to inspire young people of all genders and socio-economic background to study science if it interests them!

## Science Education & Pedagogy

I am interested in understanding the way people 'learn' to *do science*. I don't believe this is an innate skill and, therefore, must be able to be developed. 
How can we (as scientists) facilitate others to develop these skills?
